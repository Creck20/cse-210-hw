Background Trait: When you attempt to learn or recall a piece of lore, if you do not know that information,
you often know where and from whom you can obtain it. Usually, this information comes from a library,
scriptorium, university, or a sage or other learned person or creature. Your DM might rule that the knowledge
you seek is secreted away in an almost inaccessible place, or that it simply cannot be found.
